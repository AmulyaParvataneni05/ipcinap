           Mrs. Mary Samuel is wife of Apostle P.M. Samuel supported him as he pioneered India Pentecostal Church of God work in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu.  For the Gospel’s sake Apostle P.M. Samuel used to leave his family and travel far and wide.  In the early days he used to travel extensively in southwestern part of India now know as Kerala state.  Apostle P. M. Samuel ministered not just to the people who spoke Malayalam in Kerala but also to the Tamil speaking people on the southeastern part of India now know as Tamilnadu.  Later in 1932 God called Apostle P. M. Samuel to minister to the Telugu speaking people who are located in now know state of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Later in the early 1950’s Apostle P. M. Samuel traveled to Sweden, Germany, Holland, Canada and the USA.

            Mrs. Mary Samuel was a woman of prayer and faith.  Without her husband Apostle P. M. Samuel around she raised their children in the fear of the Lord. In those days the Pentecostal work did not have a mission board nor any church or person who financially supported them regularly.  </p>
            <p className='modal-data'>Whenever her husband, Apostle P. M. Samuel, and her son, Abraham Samuel, traveled overseas, typically for periods of three to four months, she would observe a regimen of eating only one meal a day, dedicating the remaining time to fasting and prayer. Her petitions focused on their safe travels and for God to use them effectively as they ministered in foreign lands among people of different languages and cultures. Moreover, Mary not only fasted but also calculated the cost of the meals she abstained from, setting aside the equivalent amount to support an evangelist facing financial hardship or to contribute toward the construction or repair of a church building.</p>

              While they were at Plathaneth House at Keekozhoor, Pathanamthitta, Kerala; they had agricultural lands, cows and poultry which provided for their daily household needs. When they came to Andhra Pradesh they did not receive any financial help from Kerala.  The primary reason was when Apostle P. M. Samuel came to Andhra Pradesh which was located in British India, while Keekozhoor, Pathanamthitta, was located in Kingdom of Travancore ruled by the Travancore Royal family until it merged with independent India in 1949. The Kingdom of Travancore had its own currency system and minted coins in copper, silver, and gold, known as Kasu, Chuckram, Panam, and the Travancore Rupee. While, the British administration used the British Indian Rupee and issued the George V series of banknotes between 1923 and 1935, in denominations of ₹5, ₹10, ₹50, and ₹100. The British Indian Rupee was subdivided into 16 annas, with each anna further divided into 12 pice. This made it difficult for Apostle P. M. Samuel to bring his agricultural income to Andhra Pradesh.

            Mrs. Mary Samuel had poultry for eggs and meat, cows for milk and manure for her kitchen garden at Zion Home in Machavaram, Vijayawada.  She managed to feed her family and pastors who visited them without notice.  Mrs. Mary Samuel used to cook her meals on firewood or sawdust stoves. She did not use any electric kitchen gadgets like refrigerators or grinders, nor gas stoves, pressure cookers etc.  She was very careful not to use the funds that Apostle P. M. Samuel received for the ministry for household needs.

            Each year, Mrs. Mary Samuel prepared a “care packet” for the graduates of Zion Bible College, consisting of dry groceries sufficient for a fortnight, including rice, dhal, and essential spices such as turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Along with this provision, she challenged the graduates to evangelize and plant seeds in God’s kingdom before the packet was fully consumed. She reminded them of God’s promise that those who “seek first His kingdom and His righteousness” would have all their needs supplied in due time</p>

            Mrs. Mary Samuel wore simple cotton sari’s and did not wear any jewelry nor make up. She did not have an electric fan in her room and during hot and humid Andhra summer’s she used a “palm leaf hand fan” to keep her cool.  She never complained about the needs of her home Zion Home but took them to the Lord in prayer who provided them.  She trusted God for all her physical ailments and even on her deathbed her daughter-in-law, Joy gave her water with glucose as she was very weak. Mary spat the glucose water and asked for plain water. Mary was a strong woman who supported Apostle P. M. Samuel in the ministry and managed the Faith Home. May the lives of Apostle P. M. Samuel and Mrs. Mary Samuel be an inspiration to future generations.

              Kunjunjamma Stephen Samuel (Daughter in-law) experienced that Ammachi (Mary Samuel) was a of deep prayer, sacrifice, and integrity, she raised her children in godliness during long absences of her husband, often fasting, praying, and giving sacrificially to support God’s work. Living simply, she carefully separated ministry funds from household needs and practiced wise stewardship. Ammachi served pastors, students, and the needy with love and faith. Her life of humility, discipline, generosity, and prayer, alongside Appachen’s obedience and missionary zeal, stands as a powerful inspiration for future generations to trust God, serve selflessly, and live faithfully.
